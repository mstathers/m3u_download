m3udl.pl will take a m3u URL as an argument and download the music files listed in the m3u playlist to an aptly named directory in the current working directory.

    Usage: ./m3udl.pl <URL>
    URL    The URL for the m3u file.


I am planning to use this on my android devices with SL4A as quick and easy means to download albums.
